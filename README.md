#### ICS3UR Class Project
# School Announcements

Welcome to my Grade 11 Computer Science Class Project. This project was created from September 2015 to January 2016.

## Project Overview

This website is a notification dashboard for all school-wide or club specific announcements. A student can pick and choose which clubs they care about and enroll into that club's announcements. A teacher has the ability to create announcements.

## Repository Structure

- `App Code` contains all the application code
- `App Design (Image Only)` contains all the mockups for the website

## How to Run

This project uses native HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The website's starting page is `App Code/Login.html`.
